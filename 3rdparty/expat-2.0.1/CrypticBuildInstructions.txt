Build only expat_static, in the following configurations:
	Debug Win32			libexpatMTdebug
	Release Win32		libexpatMT
	Debug x64			libexpatX64MTdebug
	and Release X64		libexpatX64MT

Check in the .lib and .pdb for each of these, but do not check in the .idb.

A good sanity check for small changes is to make sure the file size of the new version you
are checking in is approximately the same as the file size of the old version.
