Discussion:

We’re going to make a TCP port on the client that takes text commands that the new testclient will communicate with. We need a way to error-check commands the same way we did with the old testclient at link time rather than end up with weird run time errors when cmdtable function parameters change.

 

The solution we agreed to is alex is going to extend the AUTO_COMMAND system to generate a .c and .h each for client->client (only used by testclient), client->server, and server->client (only used by server) commands. In the future, we will try to avoid sprintf’ing buffers for cmdParse, and call the wrapper functions instead.
