Branching CoH from dev

            Yes, we really are doing it.

            Don't forget Zaphod

            Maybe move it to c:\coh?

            CoH team needs to check in everything first

            Jimb to follow up for the answers and to do it with Ben, CoH guys, Raoul.

 

Project file switches, etc.

            Shannon's /W4 experiment was too much work for one person.

                        Finish UtilitiesLib, some others though and made Conor cry once

            Who should be tracking how we do stuff in these project files?

                        Prop pages, /W on command line, #pragma, etc.

            Raoul stepped up for tracking this stuff

 

Early Movers

            NCSoft, Mike, Amy, some other ops people moving around 14 Sep.

                        Actually, just found out no earlier than 18 Sep for DSL.

            To temp space across street

            Makes space for 12 more people in this office.
